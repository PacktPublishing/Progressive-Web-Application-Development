## About the Video Course
This course teaches you how to build discoverable and engaging progressive web applications (PWAs) using the Cache API to make it offline-ready and blazingly fast service workers to intercept network requests and web app manifests, thus leveraging native-like features.
We begin by introducing the core concepts of progressive web apps, explaining each of them in detail and finishing up by implementing them into a production-ready app.
A service worker is the main PWA tool. In this course, you will master the power of new APIs including the Fetch API, promises, and more. Don't lose your users when their internet connection is lost; get hands-on with powerful caching and network request strategies to provide synchronization of data while your app is offline. Learn how to improve user engagement with your apps by adding push notifications.
We also cover app manifests in depth to let your users add your application to their mobile home screen and reopen the app as easily as tabbing on the web app icon, just as with other native mobile apps. They'll also surf while there is no address bar; the user experience feels like a native mobile app due to the addition of a splash screen, application shell, native default color, and more.
Tools are always helpful while developing software; therefore, this course teaches you how to boost your productivity by using Workbox, to make service worker management a lot easier, and Lighthouse, to show your PWA score demonstrate and how you can achieve 100/100.
All of the topics in this course feed into a practical project which, by the end of the course, is ready to deploy to production. To ensure that the app is useful for any kind of project later and also that you can learn everything in depth, the course project is created in pure JS/CSS/HTML.
Last but not least, SPAs (Single Page Applications) are super-critical as these days they perform such a leading role in web development and building hybrid and native mobile apps. Therefore, this course dedicates a section to show you how you can use Angular, React, Ember, and Vue.js to build a progressive web application.
